# ClusterXpert
## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a vital aspect of marketing, where customers are grouped based on similar characteristics to tailor personalized marketing strategies and improve customer experiences. This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to segment customers and extract actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns and enhanced customer satisfaction.

## Data Source

The customer data used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes relevant customer attributes, such as demographics, purchase history, engagement metrics, and any other relevant features for segmentation.

## Requirements

To run the customer segmentation code, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version x.x)
- Pandas (version x.x)
- Numpy (version x.x)
- Scikit-learn (version x.x)
- Matplotlib (version x.x)
- Seaborn (version x.x)
- Google Colab (version x.x) [optional, if using Google Colab]
#Getting Started
1. Download the customer dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `/data` folder.

2. Open the Google Colab (or your preferred Python environment) and run the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` script to execute the customer segmentation.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
customer-segmentation-ml/
│   README.md
│   customer_segmentation.ipynb
│   requirements.txt
└───data/
│   │   customer_dataset.csv
└───results/
│   │   segmentation_report.pdf
│   └───plots/
│       │   segmentation_plot.png
│       │   segment_analysis.png
│       │   ...
```

## Customer Segmentation Results

After running the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` script, the segmentation results will be saved in the `/results` directory. The segmentation report can be found in `segmentation_report.pdf`, which includes insights, visualizations, and explanations of the customer segments.

## Visualizations

The project generates various visualizations, such as cluster plots, segment analysis, and other relevant charts, to present the customer segments and their characteristics effectively.
